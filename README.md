## Bookie Clicker
Bookie Clicker is a [Cookie Clicker](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/)
clone created to showcase the R library 'Shiny'. One feature that sets Bookie Clicker
apart from Cookie Clicker, however, is that Bookie Clicker is collaborative, meaning
all players share one game state, as the game state is stored on the server.

A live version can be found [here](https://viz.datasci.watzek.cloud/bookieclicker/)

As this project was made in a very short timeframe, and was mainly an educational
project, it is very hacky and most likely will not be updated unless I have some time.  

### Running it yourself
Setting it up is really easy!  
1. Install [R](https://www.r-project.org/)
2. Install the [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) package
   * run  install.packages("shiny")
3. Import the library
   * In your R file or terminal:  library("shiny")
4. then runApp("path/to/bookieclicker/directory")
